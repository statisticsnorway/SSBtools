\usage{
FactorLevCorr(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Input matrix or data frame containing the variables}
}
\value{
Output is a sort of correlation matrix.

        Here we refer to ni as the number of present levels of variable i (the number of unique elements) and we refer to nij as the number
        of present levels obtained by crossing variable i and variable j (the number unique rows of x[,c(i,j)]).

        The diagonal elements of the output matrix contains the number of present levels of each variable (=ni).

        The absolute values of off-diagonal elements:
        \item{0}{when nij = ni*nj}
        \item{1}{when nij = max(ni,nj)}
        \item{Other values}{Computed as (ni*nj-nij)/(ni*nj-max(ni,nj))}

        So 0 means that all possible level combinations exist in the data and 1 means that the two variables are
        hierarchically related.

        The sign of off-diagonal elements:
        \item{positive}{when ni<nj}
        \item{negative}{when ni>nj}

        In cases where ni=nj elements will be positive above the diagonal and negative below.

\description{
A sort of correlation matrix useful to detect (hierarchical) relationships between the levels of factor variables.
